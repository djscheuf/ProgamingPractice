Thoughts:

Vision: A Dwarf-fortress Like ASCII Based game, but instead of dwarves, theme it on AI

Ideas: You (either are, or are helping an AI) reach maturity. As such you start in on some relative network, searching
for useful algorithms or query data. You'll manage Bots/Processes rather than Dwarves. You'll build Ports and APIs to
improve your crafting of components. You can 'trade' with Google or other search engines, by producing indexed data,
from your 'data-mining'.  YOu can build 'native directories' for your Bots to rest in. You can assign bots to direct bots.
You can create squads to fight Malware, and other viruses, as well as defend yourself against an Anti-virus software sweep.

Concept in DF -- Analog in AI Game
Dwarves -- Bots
Craft Stone Good -- Produce Indexed Data
Ores -- Useful Algorithms / Data
Stairs -- Links
Bed -- Directory
Door -- Lock
Workshop -- Ports / APIs
Traders -- Search Engines / Data Loggers
Sieges -- Anti-virus Sweeps / Viral Infections
Walls - Firewalls (various types)
Magma = Automation Suite? (can run away from Bot, but also allow 'fuel-less')
Water  = System Restore point? ( can wipe out a Bot, but also help heal)

Things need to figure out:
Active Display and re-skinning
    - need a visual theme
Keyboard command monitoring
    - Possibly add CMD like interface to issue commands
World Generation
    - Solidify explanation
    - Determine resources and uses
Game Time Scheduling
    - Event based? (Jump to next Event)
    - Tick based?
        -- Adjustable timing?
    - Play/Pause Feature
Project Organization
    - What is the minimum game unit?
        - Probably can skip random work gen.
        - Need Display,interface,commands,Bots, Scheduler
    - How to develop it in parts, and in reasonable time.
