Minimum Core Game Unit:
    - Display of a few depth levels
    - A Bot or 2 interacting with world, based on "Jobs"
        -dig    -haul   -build   -consume
    - Ability to assign/unassign Jobs to Bot
        - Preference = command interface
        - nice to have = menu + cmd
    - Move "items" to stockpiles
    - Minor Viral fight.

Software components needs:

        Health

    - Map Display
        - View Area
        - Depth
        - Icon lookup?
        - Display user designation area?

    - Cmd Window/Terminal
        - Command interpretter
        Commands:
            - Help  or /?
            - list * = list given type ( bots, items,enemies) , gives designation
            - dig /s:x,y,z /e:x,y,z = dig out a prism from s(x,y,z) to e(x,y,z)
            - pile /s:x,y /e:x,y /t:* = designate a stockpile in quadrangle s(x,y) to e(x,y) on current depth which accepts given type
            - build /p:x,y /t:* = build workshop centered on p(x,y) at current depth of a given type
            - move /u /d /n:* = change depth up or down 1 level or to a particular level given by n
            - priority /j:* /n:* = change priority of job in Scheduler to number (0 = highest)
            - scheduler /new /old = sets scheduler parameters to either Newest first, oldest first

    - Scheduler
        Knows Bots
        - Used Bot Allowed Jobs to schedule known labor
        Knows priorities, assigns by Highest to Lowest, Oldest to Newest?
        Shows Scheduled Tasks and Bot Associated for display.

    - Game "Clock"
        Manage TPS or Events?
        Communicate with Scheduler
