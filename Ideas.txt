1. XML Crawler
	- GUI, to read through and display XML file structure
	- Specifically for larger files, should define data types
	- Possible with examples.
	
	UI:
		- Rudimentary input screen ( file select)
		- Text display of heirarchical structure
			- Should be something like::
				HigherClass::<struct>
					Name::<string> - this, that
					FlagGroup::<struct>
						Flag1::<bool> - true, false
		- And then an option to save the summary to another text file.
		- Might consider colored text on the summary view page.
